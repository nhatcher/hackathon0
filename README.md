Introduction
============

This is small game done by Tamás and Nicolás.
Done as a proof of cocenpt for a hackathon on Saturday, 2nd March 2019. Regrettably I (Nicolás) was sick so we did not go as far as we could have.
But it was a great fun experience!

To play you need:

1. A server
2. A viewer (screen connected to a browser)
3. A set of controllers (phones)

Start the server by (dependencies: node, socket.io, express)

$ node server.js

Set a browser to the url:3000/viewer
Ser each controller to url:3000/controller

Have fun!
